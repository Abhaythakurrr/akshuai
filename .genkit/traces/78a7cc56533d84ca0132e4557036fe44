She's not a drunkard, but her fighting style mimics the unpredictable swaying and stumbling of someone intoxicated, masking her true precision and speed.\\n\\n**Race:**  Custom Lineage (Variant Human).  This allows for a feat at 1st level, which we'll take as Mobile.  This reflects her agility and ability to move swiftly through the battlefield.\\n\\n**Class:** Monk (Way of the Drunken Master).  The unpredictable nature of the Drunken Master perfectly fits Zephyr's wind-like movements.\\n\\n**Alignment:** Chaotic Good.  She acts according to her own sense of justice, often bending rules and conventions to achieve what she deems right, but her heart is ultimately in the right place.\\n\\n**Background:** Outlander.  She grew up in a remote mountain village, constantly exposed to the elements.  This shaped her connection to nature and her ability to move with the wind.  She left her home to seek out greater challenges and to understand the world beyond her isolated community.\\n\\n**Stats (using Standard Array):**\\n\\n* Strength: 8 (-1)\\n* Dexterity: 16 (+3)\\n* Constitution: 14 (+2)\\n* Intelligence: 10 (+0)\\n* Wisdom: 12 (+1)\\n* Charisma: 15 (+2)\\n\\n**Skills:** Acrobatics +5, Athletics +1, Perception +3, Stealth +5, Persuasion +4\\n\\n**Personality:** Zephyr is playful and lighthearted, often cracking jokes even in tense situations.  However, she possesses a sharp wit and a keen understanding of human nature.  She is fiercely independent and dislikes being tied down by rules or expectations.  Beneath her carefree exterior lies a deep well of compassion and a strong sense of justice.  She is fiercely protective of those she cares about.\\n\\n**Appearance:** Zephyr is lithe and agile, with long, flowing hair that often whips around her as she moves.  She wears simple, loose-fitting clothing that allows for maximum freedom of movement.  Her eyes are bright and expressive, reflecting her playful nature.  She often carries a small, intricately carved flute, which she uses to meditate and connect with the wind.\\n\\n**Backstory Details:** Zephyr's village was once attacked by a band of ruthless mercenaries.  She witnessed the destruction firsthand and, though she was too young to fight effectively, the experience fueled her desire to become strong and protect the innocent.  Her training as a monk was unconventional, guided by the whispers of the wind and the lessons learned from observing the natural world.\\n\\n**Roleplaying Notes:** Zephyr speaks in a light, airy voice, often punctuated by laughter.  She uses her unpredictable fighting style to her advantage, confusing and disorienting her opponents.  She is quick to offer help to those in need, but equally quick to walk away from situations that she deems pointless or morally compromising.\\n\\n**Equipment:**  Simple monk's robes, a small flute, a pouch of pebbles, a traveler's pack containing basic supplies.\\n\\n\\nThis character is a departure from a direct \\\"wind spirit\\\" archetype, instead using the spirit's essence to inform a more nuanced and complex personality and fighting style.
