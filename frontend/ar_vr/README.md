# AkshuAI AR/VR Frontend

This directory is intended to contain the Unity project for the AkshuAI Augmented Reality (AR) and Virtual Reality (VR) frontend.

To set up the AR/VR frontend, you will need to:

1.  Install Unity and the necessary build platforms (e.g., Android, iOS, Windows Build Support).
2.  Create a new Unity project inside this `ar_vr` directory or copy an existing project here.
3.  Implement the AR/VR experiences and integrate with the AkshuAI backend services.

This README serves as a placeholder. The actual project files and structure will be managed by Unity.
